# UNDERCOVER CHAT APP

An Express/Node.js message board app. Only members can post and edit messages! All data is stored on MongoDB, and it is hosted on Railway.

Building this app was a great way for me to learn more about authentication and data security (especially user information), and another great exercise to use MongoDB.

**Check it out:** [Undercover Chat](https://undercover-chat-production.up.railway.app/)
